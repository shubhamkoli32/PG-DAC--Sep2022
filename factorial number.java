1- start 
2- declare a variable to store a number.
3- ask the user to initialize the number.
4- check whether it is possible to calculate the factoriaal or not.
5- if the number is greater than and equal to 0, then call a recursive function to calculate the factorial of the entered number
6- if the number is lesser than 0, print the message that it is not possible to calculate the factorial.
7- if the entered number is 0 or 1, then return 1.
8- if entered number is othe than 0 or 1, then calculate the factorial by recursively calling the same method.
9- return the result.
10- print the factorial of the entered number.
11- stop
